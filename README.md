## Project KPI :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this Project, I have generated measures like Total Loan Applications i.e. 38.6K, its Month till Date is 4.3K and Month over Month is 6.9%, Total Funded Amount i.e. $435.8M, its Month till Date is $54.0M and Month over Month is 13.0%, Total Amount Received i.e. $473.1M, its Month till Date is $58.1M and Month over Month is 15.8%, Average Interest Rate i.e. 12.05%, its Month till Date is 12.4% and Month over Month is 3.5% and finally Average Debt to Income Ratio i.e. 13.33%, its Month till Date is 13.7% and Month over Month is 2.7%. In this Month over Month is calculated by (Current MTD - Previous MTD)/Previous MTD.

## Project Filters :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Project consist of three filters which are Address State of the borrowers, Purpose of the Loan and Grade of the borrowers on the basis of creditworthiness. Through these filters we can derive meaningful information like which purpose is mostly common in all the States and which State has low Grade of Bowrrowers etc.


## Insights of the Project :
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this Report, I have used three dashboards and those are controlled by Buttons inside the Menu Box. These dashboards are as follows :

### 1. Summary Dashboard :

**1. Good Loan Issued :**
This is a Progress Chart of the Total Good Loans Issued by the Borrowers. Here Good Loan refer to those loans that were paid on time with the interest rate therefore it attracts a lower interest rate. the total good loan application is higher than bad loan applications i.e. 86.2%. Its total funded amount and total amount received is also higher than Bad Loans.

**2. Bad Loan Issued :**
This is a Progress Chart of the Total Bad Loans Issued by the Borrowers. Here Bad Loan refer to those loans that were not paid on time with the interest rate therefore it has higher interest rate. the total bad loan application is less than good loan applications i.e. 13.8%. Its total funded amount and total amount received is also lesser than Good Loans.

**3. Loan Status :**
This is a Table of Loan Status means Charged Off, Current or Fully Paid. In this I have comparison between these three Loan Status then I found that Fully Paid type Applications are more than other two applicatons. Therefore its Average Interest Rate and Average Debt to Income Ratio is less than others. Current Loan type is less than other therefore its Average Interest Rate and Average Debt to Income Ratio is high.

### 2. Overview Dashboard :

**1. Total Loan Application by Month :**
This is an Area Chart, from which I got that from January there is slightly decline till Feburary then afterward there is rapid growth in the total Application till last month. From 2.3K in January it became 4.3K till December.

**2. Total Loan Application by State :**
In this Map Chart, I got that California (CA) has maximum loan applications than other states followed by New York (NY) and Florida (FL) whereas Maine (ME) has the least laon applications followed by Nebraska (NE) and Iowa (IA).

**3. Total Loan Application by Term :**
In the Donut Chart, I have presented two types of term of loan i.e. 36 months and 60 months and I came to know from this Chart is that people motly borrow loan for 36 months, mean out of total applications, 28.2K applications are for 36 months and rest 10.3K applications are for 60 months.

<a><img align="centre" src="">

**4. Total Loan Application by Employment Length :**
This is a Horizontal Bar Chart that represent the total employment experience of the borrowers which indicates that mostly borrowers belongs in 10+ years of experience followed by 1 and 2 years of experience whereas least belongs in 9 years of experience followed by 8 and 7 years of experience.

**5. Total Loan Application by Purpose :**
In this I have used Horizontal Lollipop Chart that displays the comparison between the purpose of loan on the basis of total loan applications in which I found that people mostly borrow loan for the purpose of Debt Consolidation followed by Credit Card whereas rarely they borrow for renewable_energy, education and vacation.

<a><img align="centre" src="">

**6. Total Loan Application by Home Ownership :**
Under this Tree Map Chart that shows the comparison between the home ownership status of the borrower on the basis of total loan applications in which I got that most of the borrowers belongs to Rent house followed by Mortgage whereas least belongs to Own house and others.

### 3. Detail Dashboard :

**1. Loan Id Detail :**
This is a Table of a brief detail about the Borrowers Loan Id. This include loan Id of the borrowers, their purpose,their home ownership status, their grade, their subgrade, date of issue, their loan amount, interest rate, installment and total payment.

## Conclusion :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Dashboard is of Financial Loan Statement of US Bank under which I have analyzed total loan application with various types of borrowers on the basis of month, state, term, employment length, purpose, home ownership, good loan and bad loan. This will help us to get meaningful information about types of loan in US mostly borrowed, the common purpose in whole US for borrowing loan, common borrower, Grade of the borrowers in US etc. This finally conclude that maximum total application is issued in CA state of US, it is mostly issued in December month, major term is 36 months, maximum employment length who has borrowed is +10 years, major purpose is Debt Consolidation and major borrower's home ownership is rent and mortgage.
